# Predicting County Population Trends
This jupyter notebook includes Python code to clean and visualize U.S. census county population data for five years, 
followed by models to predict upward or downward trends by county in the sixth year. Regression, random forest, and 
an adaptation of the Hamilton-Perry model were used.
